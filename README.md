# Social-Network-API

## Description:
Hello and welcome to my Social Network API challenge. This app was made in order to allow users to share their thoughts and reactions to what some people have to say and to form friendships with the add friend function. It helps with dealing with large amounts of unstructured data by turning it into a readable json format.

## How to use:
Clone down the repo and run the command npm run start (after installing dependencies) and open thunderclient or other service to start working with your data.

### Side note:
Adding reactions and friends does work but for some reason rendering the information doesn't work so deleting reactions and friends can't be done since the reactionID and friendID information isn't being displayed for some reason.
